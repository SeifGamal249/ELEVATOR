# ELEVATOR
we made this repo for the elevator code, we added the final version of the code and we will make updates on this code in the future.
We used an encoder to make precise stops on the required floor.
LCD for printing the state of the elevator.
load cell sensor for controlling the weight that entered the elevator if the weight is over then the elevator stops moving and prints overweight when the weight is decreased the elevator continues motion.
servo to control the speed of the elevator and soft start and soft stop.
3 dc motors, for each floor a dc motor and 2 limit switches for moving the door and stops it.
